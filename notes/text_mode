TEXT MODE
	it is a simple mode used in legacy systems and x86 system for outputting characters into a computer screens , it essentially enables us to use the os in a console mode, the whole computer screen is treatedas a grid of charactres instead of pixels, which enables us to write a n ASCII character to location(row,column) in the grid, and we can choose from about 16 different colours,

it is comparitevely faster than graphical interfaces and eaiser to implement because we are not rendering every pixel but every letter or every, cell in the grid,

genral resolution, 80column x 25rows
	each cell has a character which is marked by 2 bytes, 
	1byte= ASCII character
	2byte=color
	
vedio memorystarts at 0xb800
char* vedio=(char*) 0xb800;
vedio[0]= 'h';
vedio[1]=0x1f;

this will give a h at the top left corner
 
the color attribute which is the byte followed by ascii char
has the following  format:

lower 4bits (0-3):foreground (4bits, 15colours)
upper 3bits (4-6):background (3bits, 7colours)
bit 7: blink bit
