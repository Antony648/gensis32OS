KERNEL HEAP 
	it is the heap that is used by kernel for quick access of memory, we need to take a different
	approach in building a kernel heap algo because kmalloc() expects, data to be in 4kb blocks 
	that can be mapped to physical memory quickly, and the time constraint is high, and we need continous
	blocks of data 
	so implementation of malloc() is very different from kmalloc()
	and also the kernel heap and user space heap is very far apart
	
	heap.h and heap.c will help us to create a heap they are not going to create the actual kernel heap 
	itself but are more like functions that once created will be useful for creating heap structures
	in our kernel heap we  are trying to create a heap of size 100mb
	each block is of size 4096 bytes or 4kb
	100mb is 1024*1024*100 bytes 
	so total number of blocks are 25600 (1024*25)
