PAGING 

WORKDONE:
    implemented paging, set up a two level, 32bit paging, that deals with data in 4kb pages
    created functions for creating page directory tables and page tables, and fill entries in all ofthem, we allocate about a 4mb+4kb blocks
    also functions for loading directory table and enabling paging
    functions for  setting values to individual entries in a page table
    tested if paging works fine by using memory dump as well as by running code after enabling paging

    this work was done in a span of two days, but it would make more sense on explaining it together
