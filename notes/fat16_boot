nop

OEMIdentifier 			db 'GEN32 OS' 
	this is the a string that just shows the start, not so imprortant for functionality
bytespersect			dw	0x200	
	it says the size of a sector is 512 bytes(0x200)
sectperclust			db	0x80
	this gives 128 sectors per cluster this is huge, usually we stick with 1-8
reservedsect			dw	0xc8
	this means 200 reserved sectors between fat table and boot sector, this where our os code sits as per makefile
fatcopies			db	0x02
	this means we have like 2 fat tables one is the one used for reference other is a backup,
rootdirents			dw 	0x40
	this means we have 64 directory entries,
sectnum				dw	0x00
	sector count, 0x00 means use "sectbig"
mediatype			db	0xf8
	0xf8 implies it is a fixed disk
sectperfat			dw	0x100
	this means that we have 256 sectors per FAT
sectpertrack			dw	0x20
	32 sectors per track, we consider it like a cd track
numheads			dw	0x40
	number of heads is 64
hiddensect			dd	0x00
	hidden sectors before partition is set to 0
sectbig				dd  0x773594
	total number of sectors, as we gave it as 0x00, we use sectbig, so we have 7865492 sectors around 3.7

;extended BPB
drivenum			db	0x80
	it shows it  is the first hard drive
WinNTbit			db	0x00
	it means reserved
sign				db  	0x29
	indicates that next feilds are valid
volID				dd	0xd105
	serial number of 
volIDString			db	'GEN32  BOOT'
	it says the volume label is GEN32 BOOT, it should be exactly 11 characters and if smaller pad it with extra 0
sysIDString			db  	'FAT16   '
	it mentions the file system type

the uppper 
EXPALANTION:-
	OEMIdentifier :this is an 8 byte feild that contains the original equipment manufacture identifier, it specifies the name of the operatiing system that formatted the volume, the value GEN32 OS is a custom identifier,

	bytespersect:it is a 2byte field that indicates the number of bytes per sector, 0x200 is a common value for FAT16 it means 512 bytes

	sectperclust:it is a single byte field that specifies how many sectors make up a cluster the value given here is 0x80, this evaluates to 128. this is relatively large compared to other implementations

	reservedsect:it specifies the size of boot partition, it is generally a single sector, the value given os 0xc8, which evaluates to 200, this is huge, it has been given so because we have placed our kernel code here, so 200 sectors would be more than enough for it, for time being, actually we should place kernel as a file in data sector with its own cluster values in FAT and direntries, and code the bootloader to read fat and load it to a location 0x100000 in ram

	fatcopies: it a single byte feild that says how many fat copies are present in total, we have given 0x02, meaning we have one for actual fat and one for backup just in case the first one gets corrupted

	roodirentries:it is a 2 byte feild that specifies the maximium number of directory entries , all files have a directory entry this evaluates to how many files and subdirectories we can have, the value here is 0x40, (64) for now but will be expanded accordingly for more files

	sectnum: this is a 2 byte feild that specifies the total number of sectors in the volume, this value is used for volumes with fewer sectors lesser than 65536, the value given is 0x00, meaning we will use value in sectbig

	media type:this is a 1byte feild that specifies the media type,we gave 0xf8, this indicates harddrive

	sectperfat: it is a 2 byte field tha indicates the number of sectors per fat table,size of fat table, whe have given 256, the size of FAT depends on the total number of clusters on the disk

	sectpertrack: it a 2 byte field that represents the number of sectors per track,we have given a value of 0x20 (32 in decimal) it is a standard value,
	
	numheads:it is a 2 byte field that reperesents number of heads, we have given 0x40 meaning 64 in decimal, this is a standard value

	hiddensect:it is 4byte feild that indicates the number of hidden sectors in the volume, 0x00 means hidden sectors

	sectbig:	it is a 4 byte feild that represents number of sectors in the volume, 0x773594, is is common value for a harddisk partition and is used in sectnum since we gave it as 0x00


EXTENDED BPB(BIOS PARAMETER BLOCK)

	drivenum : it is 1 byte field that BIOS drive number,this typically corresponds to the first hand disk
	WinNTBit:this is a 1 byte field is a reserved bit for windows NT

	sign:this is a single byte field, it is set to 0x29 it indicates the presence of extended BPB feilds
	volid:it is 4byte field that is unique volume serial number generated when the volume is formatted
	volidstring:11byte field that says volume name
	suyidstring:this is a 8byte field that indicates file system name as user readable string

out of all the fields
	volIDString
	sysIDString
	volID
	OEMIdentifier
are for only user understanding and are not so critical

from the above setup we should undrestand as the current layout of our volume as

reserved sectors: sectors 0-199(200 sectors in total)
FAT1:	sectors 200-445(256 sectors in total)
FAT2:	secotrs 456-711(256 sectors in total)
root dir: sectors 712-715(4 sectors in total)
data area: remaining sectors 716-7812499
